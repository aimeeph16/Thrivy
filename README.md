# Project Notes
Currently, we are unable to deploy to  thrivy.site due to our unfamiliarity in deploying two different servers under one domain. We sincerely apologize for the incompletion of this aspect of the project, as we have decided to separate our backend and frontend parts into differing folders and have put the admin and main site into differing servers. We highly appreciate your understanding regarding this.

## How to see our project
- Admin server: localhost:4000
  - further details on how to access is in the frontend folder
- Main server: localhost:3000
- admin username: admin@admin.com | password: 12345
