# Project Notes
Currently, we are unable to deploy to  thrivy.site due to our unfamiliarity in deploying two different servers under one domain. We sincerely apologize for the incompletion of this aspect of the project, though we do appreciate your understanding in this.

## How to see our project
- Admin server: localhost:4000
  - further details on how to access is in the frontend folder
- Main server: localhost:3000
- admin username: admin@admin.com | password: 12345
